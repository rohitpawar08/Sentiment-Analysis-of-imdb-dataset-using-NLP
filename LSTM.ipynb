Why is an LSTM better than a standard RNN? Standard RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. LSTMs overcome this by having an extra recurrent state called a cell, \n"," - which can be thought of as the \"memory\" of the LSTM - and the use use multiple gates which control the flow of information into and out of the memory.\n","\n","Thus, the model using an LSTM looks something like (with the embedding layers omitted):\n","\n","\n","\n","The initial cell state, like the initial hidden state is initialized to a tensor of all zeros.

These define how your data should be processed. In our sentiment classification task the data consists of both the raw string of the review and the sentiment, either \"pos\" or \"neg\".\n","\n","The parameters of a `Field` specify how the data should be processed. \n","\n","We use the `TEXT` field to define how the review should be processed, and the `LABEL` field to process the sentiment. \n","\n","Our `TEXT` field has `tokenize='spacy'` as an argument. This defines that the \"tokenization\" (the act of splitting the string into discrete \"tokens\") should be done using the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) tokenizer. If no `tokenize` argument is passed, the default is simply splitting the string on spaces. We also need to specify a `tokenizer_language` which tells torchtext which spaCy model to use. We use the `en_core_web_sm` model which has to be downloaded with `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` before you run this notebook!\n","\n","`LABEL` is defined by a `LabelField`, a special subset of the `Field` class specifically used for handling labels.
