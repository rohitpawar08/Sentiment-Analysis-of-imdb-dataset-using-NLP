These define how your data should be processed. In our sentiment classification task the data consists of both the raw string of the review and the sentiment, either \"pos\" or \"neg\".\n","\n","The parameters of a `Field` specify how the data should be processed. \n","\n","We use the `TEXT` field to define how the review should be processed, and the `LABEL` field to process the sentiment. \n","\n","Our `TEXT` field has `tokenize='spacy'` as an argument. This defines that the \"tokenization\" (the act of splitting the string into discrete \"tokens\") should be done using the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) tokenizer. If no `tokenize` argument is passed, the default is simply splitting the string on spaces. We also need to specify a `tokenizer_language` which tells torchtext which spaCy model to use. We use the `en_core_web_sm` model which has to be downloaded with `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` before you run this notebook!\n","\n","`LABEL` is defined by a `LabelField`, a special subset of the `Field` class specifically used for handling labels.
